My Life is Currency
-------------------

Player is a post-apocalyptic version of the Quaker Oats dude.
	- most prized posession is a cache of Life brand cereal


It is the year 2024, after the fall of civilization.

The neo-capitalists are attempting to regain control of the earth, using Life brand cereal as currency.

At the Quaker Oats guy, you are duty-bound by your oath to honesty, integrity, and purity to stop them.

Retrieve all the cereal before it is too late!


Game mechanics
--------------
- search each level for the boxes of Life cereal - number on each level is (lvl + 1)
	- one capitalist per box of serial
	- clerks: floor(lvl * 2)
	- pouches: ceil(lvl * 0.8)
	- mans: on lvls 3 and 5
	
level	cereal	capitalists	clerks	pouches	mans
1		2		2			2		1		0
2		3		3			4		2		0
3		4		4			6		2		1
4		5		5			8		3		0
5		6		6			10		4		1
