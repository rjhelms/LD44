My Life is Currency
-------------------

Player is a post-apocalyptic version of the Quaker Oats dude.
	- most prized posession is a cache of Life brand cereal


It is the year 2024, after the fall of civilization.

The neo-capitalists are attempting to regain control of the earth, using Life brand cereal as currency.

At the Quaker Oats guy, you are duty-bound by your oath to honesty, integrity, and purity to stop them.

Retrieve all the cereal before it is too late!
